NucleaSim Studio
================

A lightweight, browser-based scientific simulation workspace inspired by Modelica.

Quick start
-----------
1. Start a static server in the repo root:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. Open the app at http://localhost:8000/index.html

Features
--------
- Model explorer with three presets (Mass-Spring-Damper, Predator–Prey, Thermal Network)
- Parameter deck with live editing and runtime metrics
- Canvas-based plot with Run/Pause/Reset controls
- Pseudo-Modelica script panel and scenario insights

Notes
-----
- The simulation uses a 4th-order Runge–Kutta (RK4) integrator in the browser.
- If you see a blank page, ensure JavaScript is enabled and the files are served over HTTP.
